# Source-To-Image (S2I) ClusterBuildStrategy
The `source-to-image` ClusterBuildStrategy is composed of [source-to-image](https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image/) and [buildah](https://github.com/containers/buildah) in order to generate a `Dockerfile` and prepare the application to be built later with a builder-image.

`s2i` requires a specially crafted image, which can be informed as `builder-image` parameter on the `Build` resource.

## Install the Strategy

```
$ oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redhat-developer/openshift-builds-catalog/main/clusterBuildStrategy/source-to-image/source_to_image.yaml
```

## Usage
This Build uses source-to-image-redhat strategy to build an image, and pushes the built image to a quay repository (`output.image`).

  name: s2i-nodejs-build

  strategy:
    name: source-to-image
    kind: ClusterBuildStrategy
  paramValues:
  - name: builder-image
    value: "quay.io/centos7/nodejs-12-centos7"
  - name: registries-block
    values:
